# CNN_Landmark_Classification
This project explores neural networks by building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch and then applying transfer learning using the ResNet architecture. The CNN is designed to classify man-made and natural landmark images extracted from the Google Landmarks Dataset v2 (GLDv2).

### Dataset Details
The GLDv2 dataset consists of 5 million images, but a subset of 6,250 images representing 50 landmarks is used for this project.
Training Set: 5,000 images representing 50 landmarks (classes).
Test Set: 1,250 images representing 50 landmarks.

Landmarks include natural wonders such as the Grand Canyon, Black Sea, and Great Barrier Reef, along with man-made wonders like the Great Wall of China, Taj Mahal, and various temples, towers, and bridges.

### Project Objective
CNN from Scratch: Build and train a CNN from the ground up.
Transfer Learning with ResNet: Use ResNet architecture to enhance model performance and accuracy.

### Motivation
This project was undertaken to gain hands-on experience with neural networks, understand their internal workings, and explore the effects of various hyperparameter adjustments.

### Results
CNN from Scratch: Achieved a test accuracy of 60%.
Transfer Learning with ResNet: Achieved a test accuracy of 82%.
